This code is a simple example of a real-time data science dashboard built using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

Importing necessary libraries: The code starts by importing the required libraries, including Streamlit for creating the dashboard, as well as other libraries like NumPy, Pandas, time, and Plotly Express for data manipulation, visualization, and time-related operations.

Setting up the page configuration: The st.set_page_config() function is used to set the title, icon, and layout of the dashboard.

Creating the dashboard title: The st.title() function is used to create a title for the dashboard.

Filtering the data: A dropdown select box (st.selectbox()) is provided to filter the data based on job categories. The unique job categories from the 'job' column of the dataset are populated in the select box.

Creating a placeholder for dynamic content: The st.empty() function is used to create a placeholder that will be updated dynamically with new data.

Loading and manipulating data: The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv() from a GitHub URL. The loaded data is then filtered based on the selected job category.

Updating data in a loop: A loop is set up to update the data in real-time. For each iteration, new columns ('age_new' and 'balance_new') are added to the dataset, with manipulated values based on random choices. The average age, count of married individuals, and balance are computed from the manipulated data.

Updating the placeholder with new content: The with placeholder.container(): context manager is used to update the content of the placeholder dynamically. Inside the context manager, three metric cards (kpi1, kpi2, kpi3) are created to display key performance indicators (KPIs) related to age, married count, and account balance. Two charts (fig and fig2) are also created using Plotly Express to visualize the data. Finally, the original dataset is displayed using st.dataframe().

Adding a delay: The time.sleep() function is used to introduce a delay of 1 second between iterations of the loop, simulating the real-time updates.

This code sets up a simple real-time data science dashboard that displays KPIs, visualizations, and a detailed data view, with the data being updated dynamically at regular intervals.

The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner. 

The dashboard will have at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display. The data will be stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and the dashboard will be dynamically updated to reflect the latest data.

Users will be able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed. The dashboard will provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse Github repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.

Overall, the result of this project will be a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
